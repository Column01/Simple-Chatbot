# A Simple Chatbot for IRC
## Status: On Hold
Lack of motivation has struck me. Many streaming issues has put my drive to work on this to zero. I plan to pick this up again eventually as I would like my own chatbot instead of using the StreamLabs one with many bloated features I don't need.
## Plans
- Twitch support
- My slot game
- My join command
- Add a dice game
- Use JSON file format for user storage (UserID, Username, Currency amount (maybe use text file if it becomes too difficult)
- Add commands and an easy way to add more (possible a standard command function that searches a JSON file. **For simple command responses only**
- Possible chat GUI (pull chat from IRC and display it to a text box on a GUI.)
