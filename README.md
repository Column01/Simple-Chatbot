# A Simple Chatbot for Twitch IRC
Just a simple chatbot for IRC.

At the moment, it only handles simple command responses such as !title and !discord to give the user info. The plan is to add my slots program and my !join command as well as a currency/user storage system. Command responses can be edited in the code.

## Dependencies
- [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [IRC Library](https://pypi.org/project/irc/) for Python


## Plans
- My slot game
- My join command
- Add a dice game
- Use JSON file format for user storage (UserID, Username, Currency amount
- Customizable command responses
- Easy command additions (for simple responses at the start)
