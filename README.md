# A Simple Chatbot for IRC

## Plans outline:
- Twitch support
- My slot game
- My join command
- Add a dice game
- Use JSON file format for user storage (UserID, Username, Currency amount (maybe use text file if it becomes too difficult)
- Add commands and an easy way to add more (possible a standard command function that searches a JSON file. **For simple command responses only**
- Possible chat GUI (pull chat from IRC and display it to a text box on a GUI.)
